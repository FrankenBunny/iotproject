# ProZone: An introductionairy IoT device for gamers
The ProZone is an IoT device developed by gamers, for gamers. The device can easily be built by using the information and steps detailed in this document.  The process consists out of obtaining the required materials, setting up the development environment, implementing the software, designing the user interface, and finally combining all the steps to create the IoT device known as ProZone. Using the information and steps detailed in this docuement the process is estimated to take 8 hours.

## Objective
*ProZone was designed to be reliable in terms of its purpose, cost-efficient in terms of required materials, and beginner-friendly in terms of the neccessary prior knowledge within the area of IoT.*

To game or not to game is a question old as time. Before jumping into another competitive match one might wonder how, with new equipment, the struggle remains. Maybe it's not the equipment's fault after all: maybe it's the gamer's. Alas, ProZone intends to tackle another, previously unexplored factor: the environment. A factor usually overlooked and forgotten, the environment plays a vital role in a gamer's performance and may differ from one gamer to another. The ProZone sets out to track each gamer's optimal environment by utilzing sensors to capture temperatures, humidity levels, and light levels. The data is then fortified by insights from the gamers themselves. To ensure that gamers can continue replacing faulty gear, hindering their ability, the ProZone can be constructed by any gamer willing to take on the task. The device can be constructed using readily available, cost-effective materials found online in a starter pack. The design is straightforward and accessible, requiring no prior IoT knowledge whilst having the entire construction process detailed in this document.

A common saying states:

*It is not the destination, it is the journey that matters.*

And it remains true in the context of ProZone. As the result of constructing your own device will not only give you the ability to track your optimal environment, potentially improving your gaming experience exponentially, but it introduces each undertaker of the task to the great world of IoT. The journey requires the task-bearer to learn about multiple components, how the combination of different components can be used in a single purpose, how to implement the software required to both capture and send information to their custom dashboard.

## Platform
Ubidots is the selected platform for data management and visualization, and it was chosen to allow the task-bearer the opportunity to learn how to use REST API's and coding. It is a cloud-based platform specially designed for IoT applications. Ubidots was selected due to its user friendly UI and vast range of components used for visualization even in the free version. In Ubidots a user with a free memembership can have up to three devices and one dashboard. Each device may capture multiple variables, which the developer designates. The dashboard can then through the use of components display the data within these variables. If the ProZone was to be expanded, depending on the need the premium version could be utilized to offer a greater variety of data analysis through the expanded librabry of components available in the dashboard.

### Setup the platform
In this section the setup of the Ubidots platform is detailed. The setup is required prior to the implementation of the software in order to accurately transmit the data to its corresponding variable. The table below displays the variables, their purpose, and their Ubidots dashboard component.
|Name|Purpose|Component|
|---|---|---|
|Tilt|Captures the status of the tilt switch.|Indicator|
|Temperature|Captures the air temperature.|Thermometer|
|Humidity|Captures the air humidity.|Gauge|
|Light|Captures the light levels.|Gauge|
|TiltTemperature|Captures the air temperature when the device has been tilted.|Column in Values table|
|TiltHumidity|Captures the air humidity when the device has been tilted.|Column in Values table|
|TiltLight|Captures the light levels when the device has been tilted.|Column in Values table|

1. Create a blank device named ProZone.
2. Create the variables seen in the table.
3. Create a new dashboard named *ProZone Dashboard*.
4. Create the individual components listed in the table.
5. Create the columns for each tilt variable in the Values table.
    1. Set the aggregation method for the variable to Average.
    2. Set the span to this month.
    3. Set the sample period to 1 month(s).
6. Open the API key from the API credentials tab which is accessed by pressing the profile icon in the top right corner.


## The code
The software required by ProZone consists out of three files, `keys.py`, `boot.py`, and `main.py`. The following sections describe the purpose and implementation for each file.

### `keys.py`
This file contains the login credentials for the WiFi the ProZone should connect to, with both the name of the network and its' password stored as separate variables.

### `boot.py`
The boot file contains the processes neccessary prior to the execution of the main process located in the main file. In this file the network connection is setup since it is required for the main execution to function. The execution requires the importation of the keys file, the network library, and sleep from the time library. Once the neccessary imports are made there exists two functions except from the main execution. The `http_get()` function requires the libraries socket and time to be locally imported.

1. Try to establish a connection to the existing network using the `connect()` function.
2. If connection failed:
    1. Reset machine.
3. Try to perform the HTTP GET request using the `http_get(url)` function.
 

#### `connect()`
The function is used to establish a connection to a WiFi network. The resets the network interface to ensure that a fresh connection is established following a boot or reset. If a connection cannot be established, the developer is resetted.
1. Reset the network interface.
2. Set the network interface to station mode, to ensure it connects to an existing network rather than tries to create one itself.
3. Connect to the network with the credentials stored in the keys file.
4. Wait for connection to be established.
5. If connection is established:
    1. Stop waiting
    2. Notify of successful connection.
6. If connection is not established and time limit has succeeded:
    1. Notify of failed connection.
7. End


#### `http_get(url)`
This function makes sure that it can successfully perform a HTTP GET request. This is neccessary to later send the data using the API from Ubidots.
1. Parse the URL and store the values as their respective variables in the HTTP request.
2. Get the IP address of the host server.
3. Initialize the socket.
4. Connect to the host address.
5. Wait for response.
6. Receive and print the response.
8. Close the socket connection.

### `Main.py`
This file contains the main execution for ProZone. This includes the handling of sensors as well as communicating with the Ubidots API to send the captured data. The process requires the libraries machine, specifically ADC and Pin, time, specifically sleep, dht, sys, as well as network and requests. There exists two functions besides the main execution. Prior to defining these functions or the main execution the Ubidot variables are defined. The necessary variables are: API Token, Device name, one for each variable created in the Ubidot device, as well as a delay variable which adjusts the delay between successive transmissions to 5 seconds.

1. Define the pins.
    1. 27 is the analog input from the photoresistor.
    2. 26 is the input pin for the DHT11, set up using the corresponding class within the dht module.
    3. 22 is the digital input from the tilt switch.
3. Define a variable for:
    1. Temperature
    2. Humidity
    3. Light
4. If there is no established internet connection:
    1. Exit execution.
5. Create a infinite loop for:
    1. If the tilt switch is active:
        1. Print that the switch is active.
        2. Read the raw input from the photoresistor and store it as a percentage representing the light intensity.
        :::info
        light = 100 - round(lightRead / 65535 * 100, 2)
        :::
        3. Print the current light level percentage.
        4. Try to measure the temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor and store in the corresponding variables, if not successful:
            1. Print error message.
        5. Print the temperature in degrees of Celcius.
        6. Print the humidity percentage.
        7. Send the data to the non-tilt variables in Ubidots using the `sendData()` function.
    2. If the tilt switch is not active:
        1. Print that the switch is inactive.
        2. Follow the steps 2-6 if the tilt switch was active.
        3. Send the data to the tilt variables in Ubidots using the `sendData()` function.
    3. Sleep for 5 seconds, using the delay variable.

#### `buildJson(variables)`
1. Variables is a dictionairy of key-value pairs, where each key is the name of the variable in the Ubidots device, and the value is the corresponding sensor reading.
2. Try to create a new dictionairy which matches Json format by parsing the given dictionairy. Do this by creating creating a key for each key in the given dictionairy. The value is then a sub-dictionairy which contains the key `value` and the corresponding sensor reading as the actual value.
3. Return the new dictionairy.
```=py
# Input
{"Temperature": 25, "Humidity": 60}

# Output
{
    "Temperature": {"value": 25},
    "Humidity": {"value": 60}
}
```

### `sendData(device, variables)` 
This function uses the urequests module to create HTTPS requests. A HTTPS package requires the URL to know where to send the data, the headers to include the requests metadata, and finally, the data given in Json format.
1. Try to send the data to the API by
2. Creating the url for the HTTPS request, which defines which device is to be accessed as the given device.
3. Include the token and define the format as Json.
4. Using the `buildJson()`, parse the variables.
5. If the data is succesfully parsed, combine the components of the HTTPS request to create and send the POST request.
6. If the request was successful:
    1. Print the response.
7. If the request was not successful:
    1. Print an error message.


## Results
![ProZone](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ2pihRUA.png)
The final result is a dashboard containing displaying the current reads from the sensors as well as a table which shows the average for each sensor when the device has been tilted. This allows the gamer to actively track their environment and know when the environment is nearing a sub optimal state. The process of constructing the ProZone allows for a wide introduction to the world of IoT both in terms of hardware and software. There exists potential to learn more about the process of developing IoT devices by for exampel integrating more complex sensors, developing a prototype and design for the device, and integrating security.
