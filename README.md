# ProZone: An introductionairy IoT device for gamers.
The ProZone is an IoT device developed by gamers, for gamers. The device can easilt be built by using the information and steps detailed in this file.  The process consists out of obtaining the required materials, setting up the development environment, implementing the software, designing the user interface, and finally connecting all the steps. When following this guide, the process is estimated to take 8 hours.

*Give a short and brief overview of what your project is about. What needs to be included:*

- [x] Title
- [x] Your name and student credentials (xx666x)
- [x] Short project overview
- [x] How much time it might take to do (approximation)

## Objective
*ProZone was designed to be reliable in terms of its purpose, cost-efficient in terms of required materials, and beginner-friendly in terms of the neccessary prior knowledge within the area of IoT.*

To game or not to game is a question old as time. Before jumping into another competitive match one might wonder how, with new equipment, the struggle remains. Maybe it's not the equipment's fault after all: maybe it's the gamer's. Alas, ProZone intends to tackle another, previously unexplored factor: the environment. A factor usually overlooked and forgotten, the environment plays a vital role in a gamer's performance and may differ from one gamer to another. The ProZone sets out to track each gamer's optimal environment by utilzing sensors to capture temperatures, humidity levels, and light levels. The data is then fortified by insights from the gamers themselves.

To ensure that gamers can continue replacing faulty gear, hindering their ability, the ProZone can be constructed by any gamer willing to take on the task. The device can be constructed using readily available, cost-effective materials found online in a starter pack. The design is straightforward and accessible, requiring no prior IoT knowledge whilst having the entire construction process detailed in this document.

A common saying states:

*It is not the destination, it is the journey that matters.*

And it remains true in the context of ProZone. As the result of constructing your own device will not only give you the ability to track your optimal environment, potentially improving your gaming experience exponentially, but it introduces each undertaker of the task to the great world of IoT. The journey requires the task-bearer to learn about multiple components, how the combination of different components can be used in a single purpose, how to implement the software required to both capture and send information to their custom dashboard.

Describe why you have chosen to build this specific device. What purpose does it serve? What do you want to do with the data, and what new insights do you think it will give?

- [x] Why you chose the project
- [x] What purpose does it serve
- [x] What insights you think it will give

## Material
Explain all material that is needed. All sensors, where you bought them and their specifications. Please also provide pictures of what you have bought and what you are using.

- [ ] List of material
- [ ] What the different things (sensors, wires, controllers) do - short specifications
- [ ] Where you bought them and how much they cost

| Type | Name | Usage | In Device |
|---|---|---|---|
|Micro controller|Pico|Blah blah blah|Blah blah bla|

## Computer setup
How is the device programmed. Which IDE are you using. Describe all steps from flashing the firmware, installing plugins in your favorite editor. How flashing is done on MicroPython. The aim is that a beginner should be able to understand.

- [ ] Chosen IDE
- [ ] How the code is uploaded
- [ ] Steps that you needed to do for your computer. Installation of Node.js, extra drivers, etc.

## Putting everything together
How is all the electronics connected? Describe all the wiring, good if you can show a circuit diagram. Be specific on how to connect everything, and what to think of in terms of resistors, current and voltage. Is this only for a development setup or could it be used in production?

- [ ] Circuit diagram (can be hand drawn)
- [ ] *Electrical calculations


## Platform
Describe your choice of platform. If you have tried different platforms it can be good to provide a comparison.

Is your platform based on a local installation or a cloud? Do you plan to use a paid subscription or a free? Describe the different alternatives on going forward if you want to scale your idea.

- [ ] Describe platform in terms of functionality
- [ ] *Explain and elaborate what made you choose this platform


## The code
Import core functions of your code here, and don't forget to explain what you have done! Do not put too much code here, focus on the core functionalities. Have you done a specific function that does a calculation, or are you using clever function for sending data on two networks? Or, are you checking if the value is reasonable etc. Explain what you have done, including the setup of the network, wireless, libraries and all that is needed to understand.

```=
#Temporary code snippet
val someCode = 1
# Explain your code!
```

## Transmitting the data / connectivity
How is the data transmitted to the internet or local server? Describe the package format. All the different steps that are needed in getting the data to your end-point. Explain both the code and choice of wireless protocols.

How often is the data sent?
Which wireless protocols did you use (WiFi, LoRa, etc …)?
Which transport protocols were used (MQTT, webhook, etc …)
*Elaborate on the design choices regarding data transmission and wireless protocols. That is how your choices affect the device range and battery consumption.


## Presenting the data
Describe the presentation part. How is the dashboard built? How long is the data preserved in the database?

Provide visual examples on how the dashboard looks. Pictures needed.
How often is data saved in the database.
*Explain your choice of database.
*Automation/triggers of the data.
Finalizing the design
Show the final results of your project. Give your final thoughts on how you think the project went. What could have been done in an other way, or even better? Pictures are nice!
